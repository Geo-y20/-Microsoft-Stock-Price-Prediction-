# Microsoft Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Introduction

In the field of stock market analysis, there are two primary approaches: Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis. While Fundamental Analysis focuses on assessing a company's future profitability based on its financial performance and business environment, Technical Analysis involves studying charts and statistical figures to identify trends in the stock market.

In this project, our focus will be on the technical analysis aspect. We will leverage a dataset containing historical Microsoft stock prices from 2013 to 2021 to develop a model capable of estimating future stock prices.

## Problem Statement

The main objective of this project is to predict the future stock prices of Microsoft using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the historical stock price data and identifying patterns and trends, we aim to build a model that can make accurate predictions on the stock's future performance.

## Dataset

We will utilize a dataset that includes the historical stock prices of Microsoft. The dataset spans from 2013 to 2021 and contains information such as the date, opening price, closing price, high price, low price, and volume.

## Methodology

To accomplish our goal, we will follow these steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: We will clean and format the dataset, handle missing values, and ensure it is suitable for analysis.
2. Feature Extraction: We will identify relevant features that can potentially contribute to accurate predictions.
3. Model Selection: We will explore and select various machine learning algorithms suitable for time series forecasting.
4. Model Training: We will train the selected models using the prepared dataset.
5. Model Evaluation: We will evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics and techniques.
6. Prediction and Analysis: We will use the best-performing model to make future stock price predictions and analyze the results.

## Conclusion

In this project, we aim to build a machine learning-based solution for predicting Microsoft stock prices. By leveraging historical stock price data and applying various machine learning algorithms, we will strive to create an accurate model capable of estimating future stock prices.
